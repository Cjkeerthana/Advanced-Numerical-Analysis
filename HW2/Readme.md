# Homework 2
Here, we implement Pre-conditioned Conjugate Gradient Method and we compare the results obtained from solving a 2D Laplace equation using PCG with different pre-conditioners namely Jacobi, Incomplete Cholesky with different matrix densities. 

The questions are in `Homework2_PCG.pdf` and the report is available as `ANA_HW2.pdf`
