# Advanced-Numerical-Analysis
The repo contains the homework and project done for the course of Advanced Numerical Analysis. The following numerical methods are implemented in MATLAB and their results are discussed.

## Methods Implemented
  * HW1 - Jacobi Over Relaxation, Siedel Over relaxation
  * HW2 - PCG and comparison of Jacobi & Incomplete Cholesky pre-conditioners while solving 2D Laplace equation
  * HW3 - GMRES, GMRES with restart, GMRES Preconditioning, MINRES
  * HW4 - Newton, Broyden and Inexact Newton to solve Non-Linear Equations
  * Project - A study of MultiGrid methods as a scalable preconditioner for FE discretization of NS Equation and Implementation of MultiGrid to solve 2D Laplace equation
