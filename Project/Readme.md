# Project

In this project, a study of scalable preconditioners focussing on the Multi Grid Methods has been performed, wherewe discuss in detail its convergence independent of the mesh size, see the results of MG implementation to a simple Poisson problem & its usage as a preconditioner for solving saddle point linear systems arising from FE discretization of Navier Stokes equations.

The following are the topics discussed:
 * A brief introduction to FE Discretization of the NS equations
 * Saddle Point formulation and its properties in brief
 * Multigrid Method
    - Introduction
    - Operators
    - Algorithms & Cycles
    - Properties
    - Theorems & Convergence
    - MG method implementation for a 2D FD discretized Poisson Problem
    - Use of Multigrid as Preconditioners for Stokes problem
